    <h1>about us</h1>
    <p class="description">
      StartLabs seeks to be the hub of undergraduate entrepreneurship activity at MIT. We plan on doing this by hosting community events for student entrepreneurs to meet one another and find co-founders or early hires, connecting student startups to resources across campus or in industry and providing publicity and exposure through our channels, and holding large, campus-wide events to increase student interest in entrepreneurship and understanding of what the profession entails. Our goals are to educate members in material relevant to becoming successful entrepreneurs, increase undergraduate interest in entrepreneurship, and help student startups become successful.
